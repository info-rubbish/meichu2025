Calculate the ratio of the height of the Eiffel Tower to the height of the tallest building in the world (the current record‑holder as of [specify year, e.g., 2025]). Provide the following:

1. The exact height of the Eiffel Tower (including its antenna, if applicable) in meters and feet.
2. The exact height of the tallest building (including its architectural top, excluding any antennas or spires not considered part of the building's official height) in meters and feet.
3. The computed ratio expressed as "X times taller," rounded to two decimal places.
4. A brief explanation of any variations in height measurements (e.g., inclusion of antennas, different measurement standards) that could affect the comparison.
5. Cite reputable sources (such as official landmark websites or recognized record‑keeping organizations) for both height figures.

Assume the latest publicly available data up to the current year and present the answer in a clear, concise paragraph followed by a simple bullet‑point summary of the key numbers.
